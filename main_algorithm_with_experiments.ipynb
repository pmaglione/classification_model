    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Performing an efficient management of budget and securing accuracy are key points when using crowdsourcing. In classification scenarios the crowd sometimes can be noisy and generate a lack of concensus over tasks. The majority of the state-of-art approaches set a fixed number of votes per item and aggregate the votes with some criteria, this produces a reduction in the quality and an increment of costs. For this reason we present a smart detection algorithm which predicts the best decision between stop or continue collecting votes over a task and analyze its efficiency with different experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formalizing the problem, given a set of items $I$, a set of votes $V$, a classification function $fn$, a classification threshold $th$ and a cost ratio for crowd to expert vote cost $cr$, for each item we want to find the minimum amount of votes needed to take the decision of continue collecting votes or switch to an expert vote. For this we describe a smart stopping algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We define a 3 methods structure**:\n",
    "- the **classifier** which returns the probability of an item being classified\n",
    "- the **cost estimator** which returns the estimated cost for each item given the votes\n",
    "- the **decision function** which returns a boolean decision for each item"
